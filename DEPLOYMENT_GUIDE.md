# My 2-Day Deployment Plan

Thinking about AWS complexity vs interview timelines, I'm going with a pragmatic approach: get something working first, then show I understand production architecture.

## Day 1: Just Get It Working

Need to have a live demo by end of day. Going with Railway because GitHub integration is dead simple and I don't want to spend time fighting with AWS IAM permissions.

### Morning (4 hours)
- Add basic OpenTelemetry to Flask app so I can show I know observability exists
- Write simple Dockerfiles that actually work
- Test everything locally with docker-compose

```bash
cd backend
uv add opentelemetry-api opentelemetry-sdk opentelemetry-auto-instrumentation
```

### Afternoon (4 hours)
- Push to GitHub
- Connect Railway, deploy backend + frontend
- Set up basic CI/CD with GitHub Actions
- Make sure the demo URL actually works

The goal is recruiters can click a link and see my app running. Everything else is secondary.

## Day 2: Look Professional

Now I have a working demo, time to show I understand "real" deployment.

### Morning (3 hours)
Write Terraform configs for what this would look like on AWS:
- ECS with proper networking
- RDS Aurora for the database
- CloudFront + S3 for frontend
- ALB with SSL

I won't deploy this (too expensive and complex for interview prep), but having the infrastructure code shows I know how production systems work.

### Afternoon (5 hours)
Document the observability stack I'd use:
- Prometheus for metrics
- Jaeger for tracing (already have basic OpenTelemetry)
- Grafana for dashboards
- CloudWatch integration

Write up architecture decisions, scaling considerations, cost analysis. Stuff that shows senior-level thinking.

## What This Gets Me

**Working demo**: Recruiters see a live application
**Production knowledge**: Infrastructure code proves I understand enterprise deployment
**Cost effective**: ~$5/month instead of $50+/month for full AWS
**Interview talking points**: "Here's how I deployed simply for demo, but here's how I'd do it in production..."

Show practical thinking, not over-engineering.

## Next Steps

1. Start with OpenTelemetry integration
2. Create Dockerfiles
3. Deploy to Railway
4. Document AWS architecture
5. Add monitoring documentation

Time to execute.
