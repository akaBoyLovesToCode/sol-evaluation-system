# Bug Fixing and Feedback Process

This document outlines the process for fixing bugs and addressing feedback identified during testing of the Product Evaluation Management System.

## Bug Fixing Process

### 1. Bug Identification

Bugs can be identified through various channels:
- End-to-end testing
- Unit and integration testing
- User feedback
- Code reviews
- Automated testing tools

When a bug is identified, it should be documented with the following information:
- Bug ID
- Description
- Steps to reproduce
- Expected behavior
- Actual behavior
- Severity (Critical, Major, Minor, Cosmetic)
- Priority (High, Medium, Low)
- Screenshots or videos (if applicable)

### 2. Bug Triage

Once a bug is reported, it should be triaged to determine its impact and priority:

1. **Critical bugs** (system crashes, data loss, security vulnerabilities):
   - Address immediately
   - May require a hotfix release

2. **Major bugs** (functionality broken, workaround exists):
   - Address in the current sprint
   - Prioritize based on impact

3. **Minor bugs** (minor functionality issues, UI glitches):
   - Address in a future sprint
   - Prioritize based on user impact

4. **Cosmetic bugs** (visual issues, typos):
   - Address when time permits
   - Group similar issues together

### 3. Bug Assignment

Assign the bug to the appropriate developer based on:
- Area of expertise
- Familiarity with the affected code
- Current workload
- Urgency of the fix

### 4. Bug Investigation

The assigned developer should:
1. Reproduce the bug in their development environment
2. Identify the root cause
3. Determine the scope of the fix
4. Estimate the time required to fix the bug
5. Document any potential side effects of the fix

### 5. Bug Fixing

When fixing a bug:
1. Create a new branch from the main branch
2. Implement the fix
3. Write or update tests to verify the fix
4. Ensure all existing tests pass
5. Document any changes to the API or user interface

### 6. Code Review

All bug fixes should undergo code review:
1. Submit a pull request
2. Assign reviewers familiar with the affected code
3. Address any feedback from reviewers
4. Ensure the fix meets coding standards
5. Verify that the fix doesn't introduce new bugs

### 7. Testing

After the code review:
1. Merge the fix into a testing environment
2. Verify that the bug is fixed
3. Run regression tests to ensure no new bugs are introduced
   - Run unit tests to verify individual components
   - Run integration tests to verify component interactions
   - Run end-to-end tests to verify complete user flows
4. Update the bug report with the testing results

#### Integration Testing

The system includes comprehensive integration tests that verify the interaction between different components. These tests cover:

1. **User Profile Flow**
   - Profile retrieval
   - Profile updates
   - Password changes
   - Operation logging verification

2. **Evaluation Lifecycle**
   - Evaluation creation with required fields (expected end date, process step)
   - Evaluation updates
   - Status transitions (in progress → paused → resumed → completed)
   - Verification of actual end date setting
   - Operation logging verification

3. **Admin User Management**
   - User creation
   - User updates
   - User activation/deactivation
   - User deletion

To run the integration tests:
```bash
# Run all integration tests
python -m pytest tests/integration/

# Run specific integration test file
python -m pytest tests/integration/test_integration.py
```

### 8. Deployment

Once the fix is verified:
1. Merge the fix into the main branch
2. Deploy the fix to production
3. Monitor the system for any issues
4. Update the bug report with the deployment status

### 9. Documentation

After the bug is fixed:
1. Update any affected documentation
2. Document any workarounds for users on older versions
3. Add the fix to the release notes
4. Update the bug report with the documentation status

## Feedback Process

### 1. Feedback Collection

Feedback can be collected through various channels:
- User interviews
- Surveys
- Support tickets
- Feature requests
- Usage analytics

When feedback is received, it should be documented with the following information:
- Feedback ID
- Description
- Source
- Date received
- Category (UI/UX, functionality, performance, etc.)
- Priority (High, Medium, Low)

### 2. Feedback Analysis

Once feedback is collected, it should be analyzed to determine its impact and priority:

1. **High priority feedback** (critical functionality, major usability issues):
   - Address in the current sprint
   - May require immediate changes

2. **Medium priority feedback** (feature enhancements, minor usability issues):
   - Address in a future sprint
   - Prioritize based on user impact

3. **Low priority feedback** (nice-to-have features, minor improvements):
   - Add to the backlog
   - Consider for future releases

### 3. Feedback Implementation

When implementing changes based on feedback:
1. Create a new branch from the main branch
2. Implement the changes
3. Write or update tests to verify the changes
4. Ensure all existing tests pass
5. Document any changes to the API or user interface

### 4. Code Review and Testing

Follow the same code review and testing process as for bug fixes.

### 5. User Validation

For significant changes based on feedback:
1. Deploy the changes to a staging environment
2. Invite users to test the changes
3. Collect feedback on the changes
4. Make any necessary adjustments

### 6. Deployment and Documentation

Follow the same deployment and documentation process as for bug fixes.

## Continuous Improvement

To continuously improve the system:
1. Regularly review bug reports and feedback
2. Identify patterns or recurring issues
3. Address root causes rather than symptoms
4. Update development practices to prevent similar issues
5. Share lessons learned with the team

## Tools and Resources

- Issue tracking system (e.g., JIRA, GitHub Issues)
- Version control system (e.g., Git)
- Continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipeline
- Automated testing tools
- Code review tools
- Documentation system

## Communication

Maintain clear communication throughout the bug fixing and feedback process:
1. Keep stakeholders informed of progress
2. Document decisions and their rationale
3. Share knowledge with the team
4. Celebrate successes and learn from failures
